# Finding The Prime Paths Coverage

## Introduction

According to Prime path coverage criterion, this program will generate all the prime paths of graph whose structure is exactly defined by given text file.

>  NOTE: This repository contains a program with six different languages: Dart-Flutter, Java, Kotlin, Python, PHP, JavaScript.

> âš  WARNING: The program with Java language contains bugs that have not been fixed.
## Define a Graph

The structure of the graph must be exactly defined. For example, as the structure shown in the below picture:

![graph](https://github.com/heshenghuan/Prime-Path-Coverage/blob/master/docs/pics/graph.png?raw=true)

## Output:
![Prime Paths Coverage](output.png)
